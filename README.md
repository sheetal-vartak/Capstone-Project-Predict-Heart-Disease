# Capstone Project Predict Heart Disease

## Project Description
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Data Source

## Techniques to be used
* LogisticRegression
* LR L1 (Lasso)
* LR L2 (Ridge)
* Random Forest
* SVM
 

## Expected Results
The expectation is to find the features that negatively and positively affect the probability of Heart Disease as well as detect heart disease as accurately as possible.

 

## Why is this important
Currently, the treatments and detection are all reactive. 

* Patients are treated AFTER the heart attacks occur
* Emergency room visits cost 50x more than prevention
* Higher mortality rates 
* Family trauma and reduced quality of life for the patient
* Healthcare system cannot scale

Issues related to undetected heart disease :

* Silent progression of disease goes undetected
* Risk factors compound over time without intervention
* Patients develop complications that could be prevented
* Healthcare providers lack tools for early identification

  
All of the above can be avoided if we can detect heart disease sooner.
